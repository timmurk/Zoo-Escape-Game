# CPPND: Capstone Zoo Escape

This is a final project for the Udacity C++ course.

This project is a game called Zoo Escape. You can control the animal-catcher using arrows and throw a net using spacebar. The aim of the game to catch all animals (orange blocks) at the shortest time.

Rules: 

1. Player has no more than one net. 
2. Net cannot pass through walls.
3. All animals should be catched.

### Object Oriented Programming

|:-------:	|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| &#9745; 	| The project uses Object Oriented Programming techniques.                         	| The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks.                                                                       	|
| &#9745; 	| Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members.                     	| All class data members are explicitly specified as public, protected, or private.                                                                                                            	| 
| &#9745; 	| Class constructors utilize member initialization lists.                          	| All class members that are set to argument values are initialized through member initialization lists.                                                                                       	|
| &#9745; 	| Classes abstract implementation details from their interfaces.                   	| All class member functions document their effects, either through function names, comments, or formal documentation. Member functions do not change program state in undocumented ways.      	| 
| &#9745; 	| Classes encapsulate behavior.                                                    	| Appropriate data and functions are grouped into classes. Member data that is subject to an invariant is hidden from the user. State is accessed via member functions.                        	| 
| &#9745; 	| Classes follow an appropriate inheritance hierarchy.                             	| Inheritance hierarchies are logical. Composition is used instead of inheritance when appropriate. Abstract classes are composed of pure virtual functions. Override functions are specified. 	|
| &#9745; 	| Overloaded functions allow the same function to operate on different parameters. 	| One function is overloaded with different signatures for the same function name.                                                                                                             	|                                                                                               
| &#9745; 	| Derived class functions override virtual base class functions.                   	| One member function in an inherited class overrides a virtual base class member function.                                                                                                    	|
| &#9744; 	| Templates generalize functions in the project.                                   	| One function is declared with a template that allows it to accept a generic parameter.                                                                                                       	| 


### Memory Management

| &#9745; 	| The project makes use of references in function declarations.                             	| At least two variables are defined as references, or two functions use pass-by-reference in the project code.  | 
| &#9745; 	| The project uses destructors appropriately.                                               	| At least one class that uses unmanaged dynamically allocated memory, along with any class that otherwise needs to modify state upon the termination of an object, uses a destructor.| 
| &#9744; 	| The project uses scope / Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) where appropriate. 	| The project follows the Resource Acquisition Is Initialization pattern where appropriate, by allocating objects at compile-time, initializing objects when they are declared, and utilizing scope to ensure their automatic destruction. 	|
 | &#9744; 	| The project follows the Rule of 5.                                                        	| For all classes, if any one of the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, move constructor, move assignment operator, and destructor are defined, then all of these functions are defined.                                         	| 
 | &#9744; 	| The project uses move semantics to move data, instead of copying it, where possible.      	| For classes with move constructors, the project returns objects of that class by value, and relies on the move constructor, instead of copying the object. | 
 | &#9745; 	| The project uses smart pointers instead of raw pointers.                                  	| The project uses at least one smart pointer:  `unique_ptr`,  `shared_ptr`, or  `weak_ptr`. The project does not use raw pointers.| 


### Concurrency

| DONE  	| CRITERIA                                                           	| SPECIFICATION                                                                                                                                                                      	| 
|:-------:	|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &#9745;  | The project uses multi-threading.             	| The project uses multiple threads in the execution.                                                                                                 	|
| &#9744;  | A promise and future is used in the project. 	| A promise and future is used to pass data from a worker thread to a parent thread in the project code.                                              	|
| &#9745;  | A mutex or lock is used in the project.      	| A mutex or lock (e.g.  `std::lock_guard` or `std::unique_lock`) is used to protect data that is shared across multiple threads in the project code. 	|
| &#9744;  | A condition variable is used in the project. 	| A  `std::condition_variable` is used in the project code to synchronize thread execution.                                                           	|
